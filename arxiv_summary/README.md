The code here accepts a url to a pdf - presumably from a search on the arXiv - and returns a summary of the pdf content.

The summary is stored in the database, so searches are not repeated on each viewing.

a button linking to these summaries appears on the app's search index page; this is stated only to keep the target in mind when viewing the code.
